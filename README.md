## Gauged

[![tests][travis]][travis-builds]

An append-only storage layer for gauges, counters, timers and other numeric data types that change over time.

Features:

- Comfortably handle billions of data points on a single node.
- Support for sparse data, unlike the fixed-size RRDtool.
- Cache-oblivious data structures and algorithms for speed and memory-efficiency.
- Range queries and roll-ups of any size down to the configurable resolution of 1 second.
- Use either **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite** for persistence.
- Runs on Mac, Linux & Windows.

## Installation

The library can be installed with **easy_install** or **pip**

```bash
$ pip install gauged
```

Python 2.7.x (e.g. CPython or PyPy) is required.

## Example

Writing data:

```python
from gauged import Gauged

gauged = Gauged('mysql://root@localhost/gauged')

with gauged.writer as writer:
    writer.add({ 'requests': 1, 'response_time': 0.45, 'memory_usage': 145.6 })
    writer.add({ 'requests': 1, 'response_time': 0.25, 'cpu_usage': 148.3, 'api_requests': 3 })
```

Reading data:

```python
# Count the total number of requests
requests = gauged.aggregate('requests', Gauged.SUM)

# Count the number of requests between 2014/01/01 and 2014/01/08
requests = gauged.aggregate('requests', Gauged.SUM, start=datetime(2014, 1, 1),
    end=datetime(2014, 1, 8))

# Get the 95th percentile response time from the past week
response_time = gauged.aggregate('response_time', Gauged.PERCENTILE,
    percentile=95, start=-Gauged.WEEK)

# Get latest memory usage
memory_usage = gauged.value('memory_usage')
```

Plotting data (using [matplotlib][matplotlib]):

```python
import pylab
series = gauged.aggregate_series('requests', gauged.SUM, interval=gauged.DAY,
    start=-gauged.WEEK)
pylab.plot(series.dates, series.values, label='Requests per day for the past week')
pylab.show()
```

## Documentation

See the [documentation][documentation] or [technical overview][technical-overview].

## Tests

You can run the test suite using an in-memory driver with `make check-quick`.

To run the full suite, first edit the configuration in `test_drivers.cfg` so that PostgreSQL and MySQL both point to existing (and empty) databases, then run:

```bash
$ make check
```

You can run coverage analysis with `make coverage` and run a lint tool `make lint`.

## Benchmarks

Use `make build` followed by `python benchmark [OPTIONS]` to run benchmarks using a SQLite-based in-memory database. YMMV.

**python benchmark.py --number 1000000 --days 365**
